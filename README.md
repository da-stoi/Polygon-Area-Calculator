# Triangle Area Calculator
###### This is my Week 10 Geometry PT for my math class in preparation for the UE on Friday


#### What it does
This python script finds the area of any regular polygon using one given side length.

------------
####  How to use it
When you run the script it will ask you for three things in the beginning. The minimun number of sides, the maximum number of sides, and the side length.

------------
#### What it catches
The program can detect if you use an invalid minimun number or if your maximum number is less than your minimum number. It also deals with decimals by removing all the numbers after the decimal point. It will also detect if your side length is less than or equal to zero.
